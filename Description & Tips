This subnautica save has a large amount of subjects, which will be divised into 3 sections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vehicles:
This save features two types of vehicles, Battle/Defense, and Exploration.

Exploration Vehicles have upgrades and materials within them
that area centered around long expeditions, such as more power, personal batteries, less protection but more efficiency, etc. Exploration
vehicles include two of the cyclops submarines, the Hermes, fitting a exploration Prawn called the Tyche, and the Hecate,
featuring an exploration Seamoth, called the Hera. Exploration vehicles in the base are the Nike Prawn and the Iris Seamoth.
These are best suited for long missions, but be weary, damage is more of a concern!

Battle/Defense Vehicles are best for short-term trips, good for fighting or damage resistance. These have less power efficiency, but
pack a strong punch, holding up to many attacks. Battle/Defense submarines have higher decoy capacity as well. This type of vehicle is less
versatile, but offer good safety for a ecent amount of time. Batle vehicles are the Prawn Suits, loaded with torpedo arms, designed only 
to fight. Defense vehicles are extremely shielded and prtected, being the Seamoths. The two Battle/Defense submarines are the Hades,
featuring an Attack prawn called the Ares and the Poseidon, featuring a Defense Seamoth called the Hypnos. Battle/Defense vehicles in 
the base are the Janus Prawn and the Nemesis Seamoth.

All submarines come with lockers filled with ion power cells, firstaidkits, food, water, oxygen, equipment, and more. All submarines have
full upgrade slots, personalized to their needs. They are charged entirely by ion power cells, and hold either a Seamoth or Prawn Suit.
These come with a fabricator, around six health kit makers, a mod station, battery and power cell chargers, lockers filled with the docked 
vehicle's supplies, a small aquarium, a growbed, a coffee and chip machine, and more. All submarines are parked above base, and can be
safely accessed through the Cyclops Dock in the Moonpools Sector.

As for Prawn Suits, supplies for their type are in the storage bay.

As for Seamoths, only Exploration types have additional storage, holding vital supplies.

The Neptune Escape Rocket was not considered a vehicle in this list.

Base:
The base is a massive establishment, full of sectors and different rooms. There are vital things to know about the base, so it is highly
recommended you read these passages to make your gameplay a smoother experience.

Base Power - Power to the base is sourced from two dependant sources, heat vents near the bottom of the biome, and a colossal 
solar array. These two sources, thermal reactors and solar panels, are essential for the function of the base. A long passageway connects
the base to the solar station, made of a small base, the giant solar array, and links to the thermal power farm. Power will fluctuate a 
lot during your play, but do not worry. Power always will remain stable between two points, and will feed all base utilities. It is a
bit distracting with the scrolling numbers, and my condolences for that. This is caused by a bug when solar panels lose and gain power
during the day and night cycles. It unfortanately at this current time cannot be fixed. Emergency power is sourced from the nuclear
reactors in the Energy Sector. This power in unnecessary and not sustainable, as it needs to be fed reactor rods, found in the lockers.

Base Storage - This unnaturally tall spire holds nearly every item available in the game, and heaps of it. Each stage is marked by its
contents, and holds nearly all resources you will ever need, such as base materials, complex compounds, vehicle upgrades, power cells,
batteries, precursor technology, all vehicle upgrades, tools, equipment, oxygen tanks, and so much more. An observatory sits on the top
for viewing of the floating islands.

Base Water Filtration - This small tower holds around 30 water filtration machines, and uses a large sum of the input energy. These
filtration machines should be more than enough to cover all needs of water and salt, with plenty more to spare. Lockers hold bottles of
water for reserves if needed.
