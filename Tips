Safety Tips:

1) Avoid exiting base through any hatches, except for the Exterior Growbeds or Cyclops Dock, (view Description for more details)

2) Wear Reinforced Dive Suit & Gloves near Defense Plants (Tiger Plants), as to avoid near-instant death, and be wary of misfire to 
base, as it may spring leaks.

3) Use those hatches for emergencies, and make sure to wear the proper equipment before exit.
