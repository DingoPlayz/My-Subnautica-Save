Information on this Subnautica save has a large number of subjects, which will be divided into 3 sections.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vehicles:
This save features two types of vehicles, Battle/Defense, and Exploration.

Exploration Vehicles have upgrades and materials within them
that are centered around long expeditions, such as more power, personal batteries, less protection but more efficiency, etc. Exploration
vehicles include two of the cyclops submarines, the Hermes, fitting an exploration Prawn called the Tyche, and the Hecate,
featuring an exploration Seamoth, called the Hera. Exploration vehicles in the base are the Nike Prawn and the Iris Seamoth.
These are best suited for long missions, but be wary, damage is more of a concern!

Battle/Defense Vehicles are best for short-term trips, good for fighting or damage resistance. These have less power efficiency, but
pack a strong punch, holding up to many attacks. Battle/Defense submarines have higher decoy capacity as well. This type of vehicle is less
versatile, but offer good safety for a decent amount of time. Battle vehicles are the Prawn Suits, loaded with torpedo arms, designed only to fight. Defense vehicles are extremely shielded and protected, being the Seamoths. The two Battle/Defense submarines are the Hades,
featuring an Attack prawn called the Ares and the Poseidon, featuring a Defense Seamoth called the Hypnos. Battle/Defense vehicles in the base are the Janus Prawn and the Nemesis Seamoth.

All submarines come with lockers filled with ion power cells, first aid kits, food, water, oxygen, equipment, and more. All submarines have
full upgrade slots, personalized to their needs. They are charged entirely by ion power cells and hold either a Seamoth or Prawn Suit.
These come with a fabricator, around six health kit makers, a mod station, battery and power cell chargers, lockers filled with the docked vehicle's supplies, a small aquarium, a growbed, a coffee and chip machine, and more. All submarines are parked above the base and can be
safely accessed through the Cyclops Dock in the Moonpools Sector.

As for Prawn Suits, supplies for their type are in the storage bay.

As for Seamoths, only Exploration types have additional storage, holding vital supplies.

The Neptune Escape Rocket was not considered a vehicle in this list.

Base:
The base is a massive establishment, full of sectors and different rooms. These sectors can be sealed off with 
bulkheads to create safe-zones in the event of flooding. Sectors are designated based on function. There are vital things to know 
about the base, so it is highly recommended you read these passages to make your gameplay a smoother experience.

Base Power - Power to the base is sourced from two dependent sources, heat vents near the bottom of the biome, and a colossal solar array. These two sources, thermal reactors, and solar panels are essential for the function of the base. A long passageway connects
the base to the solar station, made of a small base, the giant solar array, and links to the thermal power farm. Power will fluctuate a 
lot during your play, but do not worry. Power always will remain stable between two points and will feed all base utilities. It is a
bit distracting with the scrolling numbers, and my condolences for that. This is caused by a bug when solar panels lose and gain power
during the day and night cycles. It unfortunately at this current time cannot be fixed. Emergency power is sourced from the nuclear
reactors in the Energy Sector. This power in unnecessary and not sustainable, as it needs to be fed reactor rods, found in the lockers.

Base Storage - This unnaturally tall spire holds nearly every item available in the game, and heaps of it. Each stage is marked by its
contents and holds nearly all resources you will ever need, such as base materials, complex compounds, vehicle upgrades, power cells,
batteries, precursor technology, all vehicle upgrades, tools, equipment, oxygen tanks, and so much more. An observatory sits on the top
for viewing of the floating islands.

Base Water Filtration - This small tower holds around 30 water filtration machines, and uses a large sum of the input energy. These
filtration machines should be more than enough to cover all needs of water and salt, with plenty more to spare. Lockers hold bottles of
water for reserves if needed.

Base Observation & Scanning - This small sector comprises of two scanner rooms, one of which is tuned to the dangerous Reaper Leviathan,
while the other is free to be used for your needs. They are slow but cover a vast area, which I found a higher benefit than the debuff
of slower load time. There are also two observatories to look over the Bloodvine Forest.

Base Moonpools & Docks - This small complex is divided into a Prawn Bay, on the lower section, (making it easier for you to dock), and
a Seamoth Bay in the upper section, coupled with a corridor higher up to reach the Cyclops submarines with the Cyclops Dock tower.
Both Prawn and Seamoth Bays hold the vehicles' respective items for easy refill.

Base Energy - This sector covers energy-related needs, with a plethora of battery and power cell chargers, as well as lockers.

Base Agricultural - This large tower covers all land-based plants in the game, both nutritional and decorative. A large storage unit is
on the top of the tower, holding the seeds and reaps of the growbeds. This is large enough to be a primary food source for the player.
Additionally, a storage unit is connected to the lowest level, which holds seeds and reaps of the exterior growbeds, holding a couple of
every single plant obtainable to farm in the game, making trips to collect them nearly futile. The hatch allowing access to these
growbeds has no defense plants around it, but defense plants (tiger plants) lie in the growbed array, so be cautious and wear a
reinforced dive suit with the gloves at all times to deflect the spikes, and be extremely careful of missing shots not to hit the base,
as damage may occur.

Base Aquarium - This large aquarium complex features a 7-unit high tank, with a capacity of 70 lifeforms. All eatable fish are within
the tank in a group of 3 each. There is also certain egg-hatched fauna in the tank for aesthetic purposes. A storage unit below holds
all hatchable eggs in the game, and each level holds live and cured fish for eating, breeding, refilling or cooking in its lockers.

Base Habitation - These are the main personal aspects of the game, with posters, toys, decorations, beds, and vital survival lockers,
and utilities. It is comprised of a bedroom, an office, a workshop, and a tank for a duo of cute pet cuddlefish.

Base Perimeter Defense - A powerful element of the base is the Tiger Plants (Defense Plants) installed in growbeds around the base.
If dealt with incorrectly, they can be a large danger to the player and the base. Due to their locations, exit hatches are emergency
only. Any point of the base can be reached in normal conditions by corridors or compartments, so going outside isn't a necessity.
If you do need to exit, wear a Reinforced Dive Suit and Reinforced Gloves to avoid taking damage by spikes and try to minimize stray
missed shots from hitting the base, as they can cause damage and spring leaks. This defense poses a threat to the player and base but
will save you from the hordes of pesky Bonesharks that get close to the base, who are killed or warded off by this system frequently.

Story:
This save has the game completed, with a Neptune Escape Rocket ready for launch, if wanted. All databank entries are found and all
blueprints are unlocked. Story-wise, there is nothing left to do. If you want to go to any precursor bases, the teleporters to all of
them are active, and the main teleportation center (found in the Primary Containment Facility) can be accessed by the portal near the
Quarantine Enforcement Platform near the solar array.
